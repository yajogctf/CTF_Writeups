 Beginner: Anti-dcode.fr

I've heard that everyone just uses dcode.fr to solve all of their crypto problems. Shameful, really.

This is really just a basic Caesar cipher, with a few extra random characters on either side of the flag. Dcode can handle that, right? >:)

The '{', '}', and '_' characters aren't part of the Caesar cipher, just a-z. As a reminder, all flags start with "utflag{".

FLAG : utflag{...}
