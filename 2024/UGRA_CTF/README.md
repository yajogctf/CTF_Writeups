# UGRA CTF

![Logo](./ugractf_logo.png)  

Ugra CTF is an open academic information security competition for beginners.  

This CTF is organized by [team Team] in a joint effort with Ugra Research Institute of Information Technologies and Information Technologies and Digital Development Department of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug - Ugra.  

I'm discovering the challenges of CTF and I still have a lot to learn. This is my fifth, and I'm starting to get the hang of it, even if I'm still failing quite a bit.  
For this CTF, as usual, I only succeeded in one challenge, even if I was not far from succeeding in two or three others. The lack of knowledge didn't allow me to implement my ideas, which would have been successful.  

In the end, I finished 284th and scored 50 points.
